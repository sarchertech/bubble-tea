<h1>Shaker Machines</h1>

<p>
  The “bubbles” of bubble tea actually refer to the foam that rests at the top of the cup after shaking. 
  Shaking machines are a great time saver when experiencing a high volume of orders. 
  You can be sure every drink will have the level of foam that customers expect. 
  Additionally, veteran bubble tea drinkers see shaking machines as a sign of quality and may be turned away by manual shakers.
