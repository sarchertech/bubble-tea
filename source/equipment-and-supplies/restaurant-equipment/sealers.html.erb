<h1>Sealers</h1>

<p>
  Cup sealers are the reason bubble tea straws have points. 
  We consider these machines to be nearly mandatory for any up and coming bubble tea vendor. 
  You cannot have the authentic bubble tea experience without stabbing a giant straw through a sealed cup. 
  In practical terms, these sealers prevent spills, let customers shake their own drinks, 
  and add an extra level of fun to each order.
