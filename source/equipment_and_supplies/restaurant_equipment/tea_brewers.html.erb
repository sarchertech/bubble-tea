<p>
  We always recommend that you make your own tea in-house. 
  Donâ€™t rely on pre made teas or tea powders. Customers can taste the difference so 
  going cheap on tea will cost you money in the long run. There are several methods 
  and machines you can use for brewing tea depending on the size and scale of your store. 
  Use our product guide to help you find the right choice.
