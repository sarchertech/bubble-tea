    When it comes to milk, consider offering more than one kind of milk 
    since a lot of people are either intolerant or allergic to a certain kind of milk.  
    Make sure you test your teas with different kinds of milk to ensure flavor consistency. 
    Here are some options to consider beside regular cow's milk.

  <p>
    People with lactose-intolerance are unable to digest the lactose (sugar) 
    in regular cowâ€™s milk. As a results, they may experience potentially upsetting gastrointestinal symptoms.  
    We recommend using lactose-free milk as your main milk base  since it has a longer shelf-life 
    and naturally tastes sweeter so you can save on sweetener.

  <p>
    Soy milk has a longer shelf-life than regular milk and is usually 
    made from whole soybeans or full-fat soy flour.
