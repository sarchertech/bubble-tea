    In general, the less a tea is oxidized, the more gentle and light the taste and aroma will be, and vice versa. 
    Black, green, oolong and white tea are made from Camellia sinensis plants with different processes and degrees of oxidization.

  <p> 
    Black Tea is fully-oxidized, resulting in a strong robust flavor. Though originally created in China, 
    black teas are now cultivated worldwide, giving you many sources to choose from. Black tea retains its 
    flavor for several years and therefore has longer shelf life. Be careful when you choose where to get your 
    tea from because machine-processed black teas have lower quality. For quality and making in bulk, 
    we suggest you choose loose leaves black teas from a trusted source.

  <p>
    Oolong teas are partially oxidized, resulting in a wide range of  flavors and aromas. 
    Called “Black Dragon” in Chinese, Oolong teas are cultivated in mainland China and Taiwan. 
    Oolong teas can be steeped multiple times, each time giving a unique taste. We recommend testing 
    your chosen Oolongs to determine if they are good for consistent multiple steepings

<% af_category "Green Tea" do %> 
  <p>
    Green tea leaves are heated after picking to prevent oxidization. 
    The choice of different heat processes bring out different flavors from the leaves. 
    Chinese green teas are usually roasted or pan fried, giving a citrus-like or smoky 
    flavors and a lighter body. Japanese green teas are typically steamed, resulting in a deep vegetal or herbaceous flavor. 
    As green teas usually lose their flavor within a year, you should be mindful of the quantity and expiration dates when purchasing them.

<% af_category "White Tea" do %> 
  <p>
    White tea is unoxidized and has a delicate, subtle, and fresh flavor. 
    They are often hand-processed from the youngest shoots of the tea plants.

<% af_category "Earl Grey Tea" do %> 
  <p>
    Earl Grey Tea is flavored by oil of Bergamot, a fragrant citrus fruit, 
    resulting in a delicate floral and smooth tasting flavor. Traditionally, 
    Earl Grey was made from black tea, but it is now also available in other varieties, 
    such as Green and Oolong. Adding milk often enhances the floral flavor in Earl Grey tea.

<% af_category "Decaf Teas" do %> 
  <p>
    Consider having a few decaffeinated tea varieties in your menu to serves the wide range of customers. 
    Decaf-versions of the classic teas are an option, but they may not retain their robust and unique taste. 
    Therefore, we recommend these naturally caffeine-free teas
